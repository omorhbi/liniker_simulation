# Two_Pass_Linker_Simulation

- This program simulates a two pass linker by simulating modules with symbols and relocates those symbols to their absolute address.

- This simulation conducts two runs based on user input through the command line. On the first run, it checks for any relative addresses while for the 2nd run, it relocates those addresses.

- This simulation also creates a symbol table for the user, showing each symbol's absolute address.

- Additionally, the simulation also disables modules if they have an address that is larger than the virtual machine size.

## Text File

- Provided in this repository is a text file which serves as some sample inputs for this program. Feel free to copy and paste the inputs onto the command line!
